        <h1>Weâ€™re changing how businesses take <br> decisions</h1>
        
        <p>In course of running a business, you need to know who you are <br> 
            dealing with and who you are competing with. Right now, this <br>
             happens through word of mouth. <br>
            That is a good way to start conversations but doing some research <br>
             on your business partners always saves trouble in future. <br>
            Our aim is to help you answer these two questions quickly and <br>
            comprehensively. We are empowering businesses with information <br>
            and analysis that helps them guess less and be surer of their <br>
            decisions.</p>
